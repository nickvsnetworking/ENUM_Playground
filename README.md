# ENUM Playground Docker Image
This is a Docker image setup to run Bind9 as an ENUM server,

It contains the config for the .e164.arpa domain and [a stack of example E.164 address examples showing ways numbers can be represented.](e164.arpa.db)

For more information on ENUM, and how to use this Container to experiment, [see the corresponding blog posts on NickVsNetworking.com](https://nickvsnetworking.com/tag/enum/)
